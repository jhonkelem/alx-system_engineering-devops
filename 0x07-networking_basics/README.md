Tasks
0. OSI model
What is the OSI model?

Set of specifications that network hardware manufacturers must respect
The OSI model is a conceptual model that characterizes the communication functions of a telecommunication system without regard to their underlying internal structure and technology
The OSI model is a model that characterizes the communication functions of a telecommunication system with a strong regard for their underlying internal structure and technology
How is the OSI model organized?

Alphabetically
From the lowest to the highest level
Randomly
1. Types of network

LAN
What type of network could connect an office in one building to another office in a building a few streets away?

Internet
WAN
LAN
What network do you use when you browse www.holbertonschool.com from your smartphone (not connected to the Wifi)?

Internet
WAN
LAN
2. MAC and IP address
What is a MAC address?

The name of a network interface
The unique identifier of a network interface
A network interface
What is an IP address?

Is to devices connected to a network what postal address is to houses
The unique identifier of a network interface
Is a number that network devices use to connect to networks
3. UDP and TCP
Which statement is correct for the TCP box:

It is a protocol that is transferring data in a slow way but surely
It is a protocol that is transferring data in a fast way and might loss data along in the process
Which statement is correct for the UDP box:

It is a protocol that is transferring data in a slow way but surely
It is a protocol that is transferring data in a fast way and might loss data along in the process
Which statement is correct for the TCP worker:

Have you received boxes x, y, z?
May I increase the rate at which I am sending you boxes?
4. TCP and UDP ports
Write a Bash script that displays listening ports:
That only shows listening sockets
That shows the PID and name of the program to which each socket belongs
